# Student Math Score Predictor

Predicts a student's math score based on their background — things like parental education, lunch type, test prep, and their reading/writing scores. Built as a proper end-to-end ML pipeline with a Flask web interface on top.

---

## How it works

The pipeline has three stages:

- **Data Ingestion** — reads the raw dataset and splits it into train/test sets
- **Data Transformation** — numerical features get standard scaled, categorical ones get one-hot encoded, all handled via sklearn pipelines
- **Model Training** — trains 7 models with GridSearchCV, picks the best one by R² score, and saves it as a `.pkl` file

At prediction time, the saved model and preprocessor get loaded and the user's input runs straight through.

## Models compared

Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, AdaBoost — all tuned with cross-validation. Best model wins.

## Run it locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JainulTrivedi55555/Student-Math-Score-Predictor-End-to-End-ML-Pipeline.git
cd Student-Math-Score-Predictor-End-to-End-ML-Pipeline
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train the model
python src/components/data_ingestion.py

# Start the app
python application.py
```

Then go to `http://localhost:5000`, fill in the form, and get a prediction.
